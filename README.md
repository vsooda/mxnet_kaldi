### note

This is the speech demo from mxnet, but for some [reason](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/9060), they removed this demo. I had contributed timit recipe for this demo, and make it work quite well.

I will update this demo for the latest kaldi and mxnet. I will update usage in README someday.

thanks for the original author @pluskid and @yzhang87.

### usage (simple version)
just try to modify egs/timit/s5/global.cfg, then  `./run.sh`, every thing should be ok.
